#ðŸ”¹ Objective

The goal is to predict the rating (usually on a scale of 1 to 5) that a user will give to a movie, based on available information such as:

User features (user ID, viewing history)

Movie features (movie ID, genre, cast, year)

Past ratings

ðŸ”¹ Steps in the Process

Data Collection

Use datasets like MovieLens, IMDB, or custom data containing userâ€“movie ratings.

The dataset generally includes userId, movieId, genre, and rating.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Convert categorical features (like genre) into numeric form using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or CountVectorizer.

Feature Engineering

Combine user IDs, movie IDs, and genre vectors into a feature matrix.

Normalize or scale features if required.

Model Selection

Use Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Deep Learning models.

In collaborative filtering, models learn from userâ€“item interactions without explicit features.

Training and Testing

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70%-30%).

Train the model on training data and evaluate it on testing data.

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE) â†’ Measures error between predicted and actual ratings.

RÂ² Score â†’ Measures how well the model explains rating variance.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Movie Recommendation Systems (Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video).

E-commerce platforms (Amazon product ratings).

Music/Book Recommendation Systems (Spotify, Goodreads).

ðŸ”¹ Example (Simplified Flow)

Input: User 101, Movie Inception, Genre Sci-Fi.

Model processes user & movie features.

Output: Predicted rating â†’ 4.5 / 5.

System recommends movies with the highest predicted ratings for that user.

âœ… In summary, Movie Rating Prediction in Python uses machine learning to analyze past ratings and predict future ratings. It forms the backbone of modern recommendation systems, improving user experience by suggesting the most relevant movies.
